"dc_description_s": "Nominal 90 x 90 meter land plots developed from 3x3 matrix of 30 x 30 meter Landsat pixel corner locations on Alder Creek Community Forest site, as part of Alder Creek's participation in globe.gov field-based earth system science program. Given latitude (roughly 43\u00b0 N) and angular measurements used to derive 30 x 30 meter Landsat grid worldwide, these plots are actually 90 meters north\/south by approximately 65.9 meters east\/west. Landsat pixel corners derived from analysis of Landsat image (landsatlook.usgs.gov). Landsat plots established as (a) relatively homogeneous internally, and (b) representative of Alder Creek land cover comparatively. Effort was made to match boundary lines\/corners between Landsat plots where possible. Plot corners have been located in field via Trimble sub-meter GPS, with error correction; all plot corners have a metal post with white plastic cap including plot ID and corner (cardinal direction).",
